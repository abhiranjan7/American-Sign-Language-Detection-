# American Sign Language (ASL) Detection

This repository contains a project for detecting and recognizing American Sign Language (ASL) gestures using MediaPipe and Deep Learning techniques. The goal is to enable real-time ASL gesture recognition that can be used in applications such as communication aids, educational tools, or interactive systems.

## Features
- **Real-Time Gesture Detection:** Uses MediaPipe for hand landmark detection to track hand movements and gestures in real time.
- **Deep Learning for Gesture Recognition:** A deep learning model (e.g., CNN, RNN, or Transformer) is trained to classify ASL gestures based on processed hand landmarks.
- **Customizable Dataset:** Supports creating and training with custom datasets to recognize additional ASL gestures or hand signals.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## How It Works
1. **Hand Tracking:** MediaPipe is used to detect and extract 21 hand landmarks in real-time.
2. **Preprocessing:** The hand landmarks are normalized and preprocessed for consistency.
3. **Gesture Recognition:** A trained deep learning model classifies the gesture based on the preprocessed data.
4. **Output:** The detected gesture is displayed on the screen or used for further processing.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/asl-detection.git
   cd asl-detection
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Dataset
- The model is trained on a custom dataset of ASL gestures.
- You can collect your own dataset using the data collection script provided in the `data_collection` folder.

## Model Training
1. Preprocess the data using the scripts in the `preprocessing` folder.
2. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
3. Evaluate the model's accuracy and save it for deployment.

## Technologies Used
- **MediaPipe:** For real-time hand tracking and landmark extraction.
- **TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch:** For building and training the deep learning model.
- **OpenCV:** For video processing and visualization.
- **Python:** The primary programming language.

## Future Work
- Add support for dynamic gestures (continuous signing).
- Improve model accuracy with more robust datasets.
- Create a user-friendly GUI for non-technical users.
